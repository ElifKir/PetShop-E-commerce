Pet shop E-commerce Website with HTML CSS &amp; JS
Website Design With HTML & CSS

I've made a pet shop e-commerce site homepage.

This project was made while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

In this project:

ðŸŽ¯HTML

ðŸŽ¯CSS

ðŸŽ¯JavaScript.

is used.

In this project, which consists of only the home page design, the colors I used are:
    --orange: #ffa500;
    
    --dark-color: #363636;
    
    --light-color: #808080;
    
    --box-shadow: 0 .5rem 1.5rem rgba(0,0,0,.1);
    
    --border: .2rem solid rgba(0,0,0,.1);
    
    --outline: .1rem solid rgba(0,0,0,.1);
    
    --outline-hover: .2rem solid var(--dark-color);
    
I took care to use the orange color as the weight.


This project consists of a navbar consisting of "cat, dog, fish bird, rodent sections.

In this e-commerce website design I've created home page of eCommerce website with banner section, some featured categories images, then some featured products with product price, image and rating. 

The photo is taken from pinterest.

The project is uploaded as a zip&rar. You can download logo, photo and source code. Thank you!
